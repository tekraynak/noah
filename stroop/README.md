NOTE

Certain parameters of this task can be altered according to the experimenterâ€™s wishes.

These parameters and their defaults are described in lines 76-87 of the script (see below). 







# set number of blocks in experiment (default = 4)
# NOTE: one block = rest + incongruent + rest + congruent
numBlocks = 4

# set duration (sec) for incongruent/congruent blocks (default = 60, must be divisible by 10)
blockLength = 60

# set duration (sec) for rest periods (default = 10, must be divisible by 10)
# note this will be padded with a few varying seconds
restDuration = 10
